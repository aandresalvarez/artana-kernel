Title

Epigenetic and Signaling Crosstalk in Cardiac Fibrotic Remodeling: Reconciling Direct and Indirect Mechanistic Evidence

Abstract

Cardiac fibrotic syndrome (CFS), also termed fibrotic cardiomyopathy in clinical literature, is driven by converging signaling inputs that regulate the fibrotic transcriptional program (FTP). Despite extensive genetic screens, direct causal genes remain elusive. Here we dissect three signaling axes—TGFβ-cardiogenic (TGFβ-CAR), WNT-fibrotic (WNT-FIB), and mTOR-metabolic (mTOR-MET)—and an epigenetic repression module that collectively shape CFS pathophysiology. Our findings reveal that upstream regulators influence fibrotic outcomes indirectly through multi-step cascades, challenging prior models that posited direct gene-disease associations.

1

Cardiac fibrotic syndrome, hereafter referred to as CFS, encompasses a spectrum of pathological phenotypes characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, cardiomyocyte loss, and progressive organ dysfunction (reviewed in Santos & Whitfield, 2021). The heterogeneity of CFS presentations has confounded attempts to identify single causative genes, leading to a shift toward pathway-centric models that emphasize indirect regulatory mechanisms.

2

Among candidate regulators identified through unbiased transcriptomic profiling, CARDEX-1 (also known as CDX1 and occasionally cited as "the cardiogenic regulator" in earlier work by Yamamoto et al.) has attracted particular attention. CDX1 encodes a zinc-finger domain protein expressed predominantly in cardiac tissue, though its precise molecular function has been debated.

3

Functional studies in neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures demonstrated that induction of the cardiogenic factor CDX increased phosphorylation of the delta-2 kinase, PKN-δ2 (abbreviated PKNd2 in some databases). Importantly, genetic silencing of CARDEX-1 abolished this phosphorylation enhancement, whereas control knockdowns did not, providing evidence that CDX1 activates PKN-δ2 in a stimulus-dependent manner. Note that PKN-δ2 should not be confused with PKD2 (polycystin-2), a structurally unrelated cation channel protein discussed in Section 17.

4

Phosphoproteomic mapping revealed that PKNd2 resides within a larger signaling assembly designated the TGFβ-CAR cascade (also called the cardiac TGF module or, more concisely, the "T-CAR axis" in supplemental notation). Multiple co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the delta-2 kinase co-sediments with core components of TGFβ-cardiogenic signaling, establishing it as a bona fide constituent of this pathway.

5

Within the TGFβ-CAR cascade, signal propagation converges on SMADL-7, a SMAD-like effector also referred to as SL7. Activation of the T-CAR axis resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the SMAD-like effector 7 in both primary cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cultures. The authors present dose-response data showing a monotonic relationship between T-CAR activity and SL7 phosphorylation levels.

6

What is the downstream consequence of SL7 activation? Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that phosphorylated SMADL-7 directly occupies promoter regions of fibrotic gene loci. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that SL7 upregulates a coordinated gene expression program that the authors term the Fibrotic Transcriptional Program (FTP), also called the "fibrotic program" or "fibrotic gene module" in subsequent sections.

7

Clinically, the fibrotic program has been extensively linked to disease outcomes. In a meta-analysis of six independent CFS cohorts totaling 2,400 patients, elevated FTP expression was significantly and reproducibly associated with the cardiac syndrome severity as measured by the Cardiac Fibrosis Index (CFI). The association withstood multiple-testing correction and was independent of age, sex, and comorbidities.

8

Given that CARDEX-1 sits upstream of a chain terminating in disease-associated FTP expression, one might be tempted to infer a direct relationship between CDX1 and CFS. However, a definitive genome-wide association study (n = 12,500 cases, 30,000 controls) published in 2024 by the CardioGenomics Consortium found no statistically significant association between CARDEX-1 variants and CFS incidence (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.97–1.07, p = 0.42). Earlier, smaller studies had reported nominally significant associations, but these were not replicated in adequately powered analyses.

9

In a separate line of investigation, the epigenetic landscape of fibrotic tissue was examined. The gene SILEN-β (also written SLNβ and known informally as "silencing gene beta" or "the β-silencer") was identified as highly expressed in cardiac tissue that showed resistance to fibrotic remodeling.

10

Overexpression of SILEN-β in fibroblast cultures led to increased enzymatic activity of HDAC-9X (abbreviated H9X), a class II histone deacetylase also referred to as "histone modifier 9X." Conversely, silencing of the β-silencer abolished H9X activity, demonstrating that SLNβ activates the 9X deacetylase.

A note on prior literature is warranted here. Chen et al. (2018) reported that H9X promoted fibrotic gene expression in a hepatic fibrosis model and speculated that this pro-fibrotic role might extend to the heart. This early claim has been frequently cited in review articles and may lead readers to assume that HDAC-9X is a pro-fibrotic factor. As we detail below, this assumption does not hold in cardiac tissue.

11

The 9X deacetylase catalyzes removal of acetyl marks from histone H3K27 at specific genomic loci, resulting in chromatin compaction. This deacetylation pattern defines what the authors call the Epigenetic Repression Module (ERM), also described as the "chromatin silencing signature" or simply "the repression module." H9X upregulates the ERM across multiple cardiac cell types.

12

Critically, the genomic loci targeted by the ERM overlap substantially (>78% intersection) with FTP promoter regions. Functional assays demonstrated that when the repression module is active, transcription from FTP loci is suppressed. In formal terms, the Epigenetic Repression Module inhibits the Fibrotic Transcriptional Program—a result that directly contradicts the extrapolation from Chen et al.'s hepatic model.

To restate unambiguously: HDAC-9X does NOT upregulate the fibrotic program in cardiac tissue. Its effect is the opposite—through ERM, it suppresses fibrotic gene expression.

13

The second major pro-fibrotic input was traced to the WNT-FIB loop (also called the "W-F circuit," "Wnt-fibrotic signaling," or "canonical WNT-fibrotic loop"). A key component of this pathway is FBG-α, a fibrogenic transcription factor sometimes abbreviated FBGA. Proteomic analyses established that the fibrogenic factor is part of the WNT-FIB loop, where it serves as a scaffold for β-catenin recruitment.

14

Stimulation of the W-F circuit by Wnt3a ligand activated the fibrotic gene module in cardiac fibroblasts. This activation was independent of the TGFβ-CAR cascade, as confirmed by concurrent pathway inhibition experiments. Thus, FTP receives converging pro-fibrotic inputs from at least two distinct pathways—TGFβ-CAR (via SL7) and WNT-FIB.

15

Whether FBG-α also influences the epigenetic repression module remains an open question. Preliminary co-expression analysis suggested a modest correlation between FBGA levels and ERM gene expression, but this correlation did not survive multiple-testing correction (adjusted p = 0.12). The authors explicitly characterize any FBG-α–ERM relationship as speculative at present.

16

The third signaling axis investigated was the mTOR-MET branch (also termed "the metabolic arm," "M-branch," or "metabolic mTOR module"). This pathway operates largely independently of the fibrotic axes and governs metabolic adaptation in cardiomyocytes under stress conditions.

17

The M-branch regulates a transcriptional and post-transcriptional program termed the Metabolic Reprogramming Response (MRR), which the text also refers to as the "metabolic shift signature" and "the reprogramming response." MRR encompasses shifts in substrate utilization from fatty acid oxidation toward glycolysis.

Here the authors note that PKD2 (polycystin-2), a calcium-permeable channel, modulates mTOR-MET activity in kidney tissue. However, PKD2 has no demonstrated role in the cardiac mTOR-MET branch, and its effects in renal tissue should not be extrapolated to the cardiomyocyte context discussed here. PKD2 is structurally and functionally unrelated to the delta-2 kinase PKN-δ2 discussed in Section 3, despite superficial nomenclature similarity.

18

Clinical data from three cohorts showed that altered MRR levels were modestly associated with CFS progression (hazard ratio 1.3, p = 0.03). While statistically significant, this association was considerably weaker than the FTP-CFS link described above and may be confounded by metabolic comorbidities.

19

An important negative result: the authors tested whether PKN-δ2 might participate in metabolic signaling via the mTOR-MET branch. Despite one prior report suggesting cross-pathway engagement (Fernandez et al., 2019), rigorous kinase activity assays in the present study found no evidence that PKNd2 modulates any component of the M-branch. The authors describe any PKN-δ2–MRR connection as "plausible but unsubstantiated by current data."

20

Similarly, it has been speculated that mTOR-MET signaling might influence fibrotic remodeling through cross-talk with FTP regulators. In vitro, rapamycin treatment (which attenuates the M-branch) produced a non-significant trend toward reduced FTP expression (fold change 0.91, p = 0.08). The authors explicitly state that this does not constitute evidence for a direct mTOR-MET–FTP link and that any such connection remains hypothetical.

21

Alongside SMADL-7, several additional proteins were detected in fibrotic cardiac tissue by mass spectrometry, including NOTCH-R3 and PKD2. Among these, NOTCH-R3 attracted initial interest because of its known role in developmental signaling. However, neither gain-of-function nor loss-of-function experiments produced consistent effects on FTP, ERM, or CFS phenotypes. The authors conclude that NOTCH-R3 is a bystander protein in this context and note that any proposed association between NOTCH-R3 and CFS remains unsubstantiated.

22

Pharmacological intervention studies evaluated Cardivex (CVX-12), described as "the antifibrotic agent" in the Methods section. In both cell culture and organoid assays, CVX-12 selectively inhibited SMADL-7 phosphorylation without affecting upstream T-CAR components. This targeted inhibition by CVX-12 is consistent with direct binding to the SL7 kinase domain, confirmed by crystallographic studies.

23

As a consequence of SL7 inhibition, Cardivex treatment resulted in reduced expression of the fibrotic transcriptional program across all tested fibroblast lines. Dose-response analysis showed that the antifibrotic agent downregulated FTP in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 120 nM.

24

A second therapeutic compound, Silenor (SLR-8), was investigated for its effects on the epigenetic axis. Known as "the chromatin modifier" in preclinical literature, SLR-8 is a small molecule designed to allosterically enhance HDAC-9X enzymatic activity. Treatment with Silenor increased H9X deacetylase activity 3.5-fold in cardiac fibroblasts, demonstrating that the chromatin modifier activates the 9X deacetylase.

25

Consistent with HDAC-9X's role in promoting the repression module, Silenor treatment upregulated ERM expression as measured by both RNA-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq. The authors verified that SLR-8 had no direct transcriptional effects on ERM loci independent of H9X, confirming that the drug's mechanism is mediated entirely through HDAC-9X activation.

26

In preclinical models, combined treatment with Cardivex and Silenor achieved greater reduction in fibrotic markers than either agent alone. This additive effect is consistent with the two drugs operating through orthogonal mechanisms—one blocking pro-fibrotic transcription (via SL7 inhibition) and the other enhancing anti-fibrotic epigenetic silencing (via H9X activation and ERM upregulation).

27

Systems biology modeling integrated the signaling, epigenetic, and metabolic data into a unified computational framework. The model positions CARDEX-1 as an upstream trigger that propagates through PKN-δ2 and the TGFβ-CAR cascade to SMADL-7, ultimately driving FTP expression. This multi-step chain explains how CDX1 can influence fibrotic outcomes without a detectable direct genetic association with CFS.

28

The model further predicts that SILEN-β exerts a protective effect against CFS through the chain SLNβ → HDAC-9X → ERM ⊣ FTP → CFS. Critically, the sign of the overall derived effect is negative: activation of SILEN-β ultimately reduces disease-associated FTP expression. This prediction was validated by showing that SLNβ overexpression in cardiomyocyte organoids reduced fibrotic marker levels by 40%.

29

A common misconception in the field is that epigenetic modifiers like HDAC-9X directly promote fibrosis. As demonstrated in Sections 11–12, H9X instead promotes chromatin silencing at fibrotic loci, leading to suppressed FTP expression. The reversal of the naive H9X→fibrosis prediction exemplifies the importance of tracing complete signaling chains rather than relying on extrapolations from other tissue contexts.

30

Finally, the authors emphasize several boundaries of their conclusions. First, the CDX1–CFS direct association is refuted by genetic evidence. Second, the FBG-α–ERM cross-talk remains speculative. Third, the PKN-δ2–MRR connection is unsubstantiated. Fourth, the mTOR-MET–FTP link is hypothetical. And fifth, NOTCH-R3 shows no established functional relationship with any fibrotic or disease endpoint studied here. These negative and provisional results are essential for interpreting the positive mechanistic findings within appropriate epistemic constraints.
